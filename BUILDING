Building JOpenFrameworks

Pre-requisites:
You need git and svn installed. 
In Windows, you need Visual Studio 2010
In Mac you need XCode


First we need to check out the sources and build v8:

1. Download and extract OpenFrameworks. Extract it to 'of' directory

2. Go to apps/examples and create the jof directory:
	cd of/apps/examples
	mkdir jof
	cd jof

3. Checkout the source code
	git clone --recursive git@github.com:codeboost/JOpenFrameworks.git .
	
4. Checkout google v8 into deps/v8:
	mkdir deps/v8
	svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ deps/v8
	
5. Build v8 (For options, see: http://code.google.com/apis/v8/build.html):
	cd deps/v8
	scons mode=release library=shared

6. On Mac / Linux, install the boost libraries (I don't like this dependency, because only boost::filesystem::path is used)	:
See www.boost.org for installation instructions for your platform.

7. Now depending on your platform, let's build it:

Windows (Visual Studio 2010):
Open the solution jof.sln and hit F7 to build.

MacOS (XCode):
Open the xcode project and build.
